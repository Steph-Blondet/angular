  // The HeroService.getHeroes() method has a synchronous signature, which implies that the HeroService can fetch heroes synchronously. The HeroesComponent consumes the getHeroes() result as if heroes could be fetched synchronously.
  // getHeroes(): void {
  //   this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();
  // }

  // The HeroService.getHeroes method used to return a Hero[]. Now it returns an Observable<Hero[]>. You'll have to adjust to that difference in HeroesComponent. Find the getHeroes method and replace it with the following code (shown side-by-side with the previous version for comparison)
  // The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€” which could happen now or several minutes from now. Then subscribe passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property. This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
  getHeroes(): void {
    this.heroService.getHeroes()
        .subscribe(heroes => this.heroes = heroes);
  }
